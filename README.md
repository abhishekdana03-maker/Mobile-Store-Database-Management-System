     - Foreign keys
     - Proper relationships between tables

 ## 7)Reporting & Analysis
 
  - To generate meaningful insights such as:
     - Top-selling mobiles
     - Total sales revenue
     - Low-stock alerts
     - Purchase history of customers

 ## 8)Real-World Business Simulation
 
   - To simulate a real mobile shop’s operations through a database that can be used for practical learning and project demonstration.
